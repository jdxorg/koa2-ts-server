## `koa2-ts-init`
> Typescript fork of [koa2-kickstarter](https://github.com/umayr/koa2-kickstarter). Wondering why Typescript ? Read [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12694530/what-is-typescript-and-why-would-i-use-it-in-place-of-javascript) post on StackOverflow

### Setup
```bash
  # clone the repository
  λ git clone https://github.com/mohuk/koa2-ts-init
  # change the current directory
  λ cd koa2-ts-init
  # install all dependencies
  λ yarn
  # run the project
  λ npm run start
```

### Structure
```bash
├── README.md           # you're here
├── bin                 # folder that bootstraps the application
├── src                 # contains source files
│   ├── conf            # wraps configurations files
│   ├── controller      # contains all controllers in the application
│   ├── custom-typings      # contains all controllers in the application
│   ├── middleware      # folder with all middlewares
│   ├── route           # wraps all the routes and exports a single composed middleware
│   └── service         # contains all the service logic
└── test                # unit tests
```

**Suggestion:** Every folder name is _singular_ like `route`, `middleware` instead of `routes`, `middlewares`. If you want to add more folders as per your need, make sure they should be singular too (for e.g. `util`, `helper` etc) only for the sake of consistency.
